# RobotDynamics2022 - ETH

"Robot Dynamics" course at ETH ZÃ¼rich (Fall 2022)! This repository contains weekly MATLAB exercises and exams that cover various topics related to robot dynamics.

## Course Overview

In the "Robot Dynamics" course, I delve into the principles and mathematics governing the behavior of robots. Through theoretical concepts and practical MATLAB exercises, I learnt about the kinematics and dynamics of fixed-base and floating base robots. 

The exercises in this repository cover the following topics:

- Kinematics and dynamics of fixed-base robots and floating base robots.
- Kinematic control and dynamic control methods, including inverse dynamic control and quadratic problem optimization.
- Kinematics and dynamics of rotor crafts and fixed-wing UAVs.
- Basic control methods for UAVs.
